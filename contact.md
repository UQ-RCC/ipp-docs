The facility is home to 23 high-performance microscopes and supports image data analysis virtual workstations (with relevant visualisation and analysis software packages), with facility staff on-site to provide users with expert technical support and training.With such a breadth of equipment and capabilities the IMB Microscopy core facility welcomes users from within UQ as well as the greater community to contact us about utilizing the following resources.[Website](https://imb.uq.edu.au/microscopy)    |     [Email](mailto:microscopes@imb.uq.edu.au)     |     [Twitter](https://twitter.com/IMBmicroscopy)#### Key Staff##### [Dr James Springfield](https://imb.uq.edu.au/profile/950/james-springfield) <img src="https://imb.uq.edu.au/sites/imb.uq.edu.au/files/styles/uq_core_small_portrait/public/ckfinder/images/staff_profile/james-springfield.jpg?itok=3diU_hP-" alt="James Springfield" width="150"/><br>*Microscopy Facility Manager*##### [Dr Nicholas Condon](https://imb.uq.edu.au/profile/356/nicholas-condon) <img src="https://imb.uq.edu.au/sites/imb.uq.edu.au/files/styles/uq_core_small_portrait/public/ckfinder/images/staff_profile/Nicholas-Condon-2021.jpg?itok=Ax3Hg6nv" alt="Nicholas Condon" width="150"/><br>*Senior Microscopist & CZI Imaging Scientist*##### [Dr Deborah Barkauskas](https://imb.uq.edu.au/profile/11519/deborah-barkauskas) <img src="https://imb.uq.edu.au/sites/imb.uq.edu.au/files/styles/uq_core_small_portrait/public/ckfinder/images/staff_profile/DBarkie.jpg?itok=BEEz8ven" alt="Deborah Barkauskas" width="150"/><br>*Senior Microscopist*### Research Computing CentreThe Research Computing Centre (RCC), established in 2011, provides coordinated management and support of The University of Queenslandâ€™s sustained and substantial investment in eResearch. The RCC is an innovative and multidisciplinary environment that supports research collaboration to facilitate discoveries in science, engineering, humanities and social sciences through advanced computation, data analysis and other digital research tools.The RCC aggregates expertise in core eResearch areas, such as cloud computing, data management, high performance computing (HPC), workflow tools and visualisation. The Centre builds on key support services within the University, namely Information Technology Services (ITS) and the Library. The RCC leverages investment by government in initiatives such as the Queensland Cyber Infrastructure Foundation (QCIF), National eResearch Collaboration Tools and Resources (NeCTAR), Research Data Storage Infrastructure (RDSI), and the Australian National Data Service (ANDS). In collaboration with QCIF, the RCC manages QRIScloud, the Queensland node of the Australian Research Cloud. [Website](https://rcc.uq.edu.au/)    |     [Email](mailto:rcc-support@uq.edu.au)     |     [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RCCUQ)#### Key Staff##### [Dr Hoang Nguyen](https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/16696) <img src="https://rcc.uq.edu.au/system/storage/serve/3967/hoang_nguyen.jpg" alt="Hoang Nguyen" width="150"/><br>*Systems Programmer*

Welcome to the Image Processing Portal, 

Commissioned by IMB Microscopy and jointly developed with UQ RCC.  
 

The Portal is designed around the needs of optical microscopists to manage, convert, pre-process and deconvolve datasets on the Wiener High Performance Cluster.  

# Requirements 

### Mandatory: 

1. Have a UQ staff account with DUO MFA activated.
2. Ensure you have access to the UQ VPN - [Link](https://my.uq.edu.au/information-and-services/information-technology/working-remotely/vpn-virtual-private-network) 
3. Create (or have) a UQ RDM Q collection/s to store your input and output datasets - Link 

    *When you create the collection/s, ensure you tick the "The project data needs to be mounted on UQ HPC facilities" tick box in the Data storage options section at the bottom of the webpage. This will create a "Q" collection that is mountable on the Wiener HPC.* 

3. Once you have created your RDM Q collection and have received an email from ITS/RDM stating that your collection is ready, you will need to send an email to the appropriate IT administrators to: 

      a. Gain access to Wiener HPC 

      b. Gain access to CVL@Wiener

      c. Mount your RDM collections at QBI

### Preferable: 

 4. Ideally, you should also mount the collection/s in your local RDM cache for faster data access via your local PCs.

     *When requesting your RDM to be mounted on an institutional cache please provide the Shortcode + the "Q" code for example: MicroRDM-Q1234*
